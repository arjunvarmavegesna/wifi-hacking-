# wifi-hacking-
A private repository for educational content on ethical network security, including WiFi protocols, legal packet analysis, and securing networks.
# Network Security Education

## Description
This private repository is dedicated to educational resources on ethical network security practices. It covers topics such as WiFi security protocols (WPA2, WPA3), legal packet analysis using tools like aircrack-ng, and methods to secure networks against unauthorized access. All content is intended for learning purposes and emphasizes ethical, authorized use of tools.

**Disclaimer**: This repository is for educational purposes only. Do not use these tools or techniques on networks without explicit permission, as unauthorized access is illegal.

## Objectives
- Understand WiFi encryption protocols and their strengths.
- Learn to set up a legal test network for security experiments.
- Explore ethical use of network analysis tools like aircrack-ng.
- Share best practices for securing WiFi networks.

## Contents
- `docs/wifi-security.md`: Guide to WiFi encryption and best practices.
- `tutorials/setup-test-network.md`: Steps to create a personal test network.
- `tutorials/aircrack-ng-packet-capture.md`: Legal packet analysis with aircrack-ng.
- `docs/protect-deauth-attacks.md`: How to protect against deauthentication attacks.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Explore the `docs/` and `tutorials/` folders for learning materials.
3. Follow the tutorials on your own test network (never on unauthorized networks).

## Ethical Use
All tutorials and scripts are designed for use on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized network access violates laws and ethical standards.
